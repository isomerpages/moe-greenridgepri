# Edusave Scheme

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1993, the Government started the Edusave Scheme to maximise opportunities for all Singaporean children. The Scheme rewards students who perform well or who make good progress in their academic work or co-curricular activities, and provides students and schools with funds to pay for enrichment programmes or to purchase additional resources.</p>
