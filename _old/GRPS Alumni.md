### Homecoming

About 300 ex-Greenridgeans came back to visit their teachers on Teachers’ Day celebration this year.  The students were very happy to meet up with their former teachers and classmates. Many of them passionately shared their enriching experiences at secondary school and how Greenridge Primary has played a part in shaping them into what they are today. 

The photos below captured some of the fun-filled moment when they students reconnected with their teachers and classmates. We look forward to seeing our ex-students again next year.
