e**Learning Outcomes**  
 The learning outcomes in our music lessons are organised around five overarching Learning Objectives (LOs). All learning outcomes are addressed and learned in an integrative manner, where elements and concepts are learned through active musical experiences.  
  
 LO1: Perform Music in both instrumental and vocal settings, individually and in groups  
 LO2: Create Music in both instrumental and vocal settings, individually and in groups  
 LO3: Listen and Respond to Music  
 LO4: Appreciate Music in local and global cultures  
 LO5: Understand musical elements and concepts  
  
**Pedagogies**  
In GRPS. pupils are constantly involved aurally and kinaesthetically in the music.  
  
Teachers consider the musical background of the pupils when designing lessons and selecting music materials to tap on their prior knowledge.  
  
To develop critical thinking in music, teachers encourage the pupils to respond to, interpret and analyse musical works and concepts.  
  
The pupils are empowered to be always involved in decision-making during the process of performing, creating and listening to music.  
  
In a music ensemble, an authentic musical collaboration practice, pupils experience collaboration which music naturally provides the context, and develop collaboration skills.  
  
**Assessment**  
Music assessments are carried out through a variety of ways to facilitate pupils’ learning. These include listening activities, music performances, improvisation and written assignments.  
  
While it is not necessary to assess all the learning outcomes in one specific assessment task, all five Learning Objectives are addressed in the course of the year.
