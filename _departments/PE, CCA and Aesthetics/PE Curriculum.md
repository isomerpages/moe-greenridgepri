<b><u>PE at Primary Level</u></b>

![](/images/Departments/PE,%20CCA%20and%20Aesthetics/curri.png)

<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary level physical education programme should provide a range of movement experiences to develop students’ overall development. The purpose is to help all students develop a foundation for an active life. The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students’ performance. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games. The syllabus provides diversity and breadth for schools to plan and implement a well-balanced physical education programme. There are seven learning areas that facilitate the organisation of learning experiences in the primary schools.</p>

|   Pedagogy  | - Interactive Teaching - The instructional process is controlled by the teacher and the teacher decides the next steps based on the response from the students<br>- Cooperative Learning & Peer Teaching - Pupils get to learn from each other through partner and group activities<br>- Activities are progressive in skill development and interaction levels (Individual, pair, small group, large group, whole class)<br>- GRR Model<br> |
|  Assessment | - Getting pupils in pairs/groups to discuss what they have learnt and how they can improve<br>- Pupils to share with the class<br>- Teacher walking around to observe pupils and providing instant feedback<br>- FA Strategies (eg Peer Assessment, Skills Checklist)<br>- Summative Assessment (PE Test)            |
