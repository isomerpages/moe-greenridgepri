<b><u>PE at Primary Level</u></b>

![](/images/Departments/PE,%20CCA%20and%20Aesthetics/curri.png)

<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary level physical education programme should provide a range of movement experiences to develop students’ overall development. The purpose is to help all students develop a foundation for an active life. The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students’ performance. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games. The syllabus provides diversity and breadth for schools to plan and implement a well-balanced physical education programme. There are seven learning areas that facilitate the organisation of learning experiences in the primary schools.</p>
