### CCA

**Science Club**

The purpose of Science Club is to promote interest in science among all GRPS students. We hope to spread both science interest and knowledge to students and their families by making Science Club a fun, welcoming environment where science is relevant and useful. We hope to develop and expand the critical thinking and problem solving skills among the students who participate in Science Club.
