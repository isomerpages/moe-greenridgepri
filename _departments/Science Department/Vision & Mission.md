# Vision & Mission
#### Vision

Hands-on Passionate Learners, Minds-on Scientific Inquirers

####  Mission

To develop inquisitive and lifelong learners through the acquisition of scientific knowledge and inquiry skills  
  
The department aims to conduct Science lessons in an interesting and engaging way by using the 5E Model. During the lessons, pupils will get to have hands-on experience and the opportunity to be self-directed learners. Through this teaching model, we can ensure that pupils develop interest in Science while being Hands-on Passionate Learners and Minds-on Scientific Inquirers.
