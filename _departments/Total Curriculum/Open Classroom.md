<b><u>Greenridge Primary School – Open Classroom</u></b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Greenridge Primary School has a culture of Open Classrooms. Lead and senior teachers invite fellow teachers into their classrooms to observe their lessons. These sessions lead to meaningful discussions on teaching and learning matters, and in the open sharing of classroom practices.&nbsp;The sessions allow teachers to reflect with one another on the way they teach and how students learn better. The teachers in the school are models of continuous life–long learning. They take pride in upgrading their skills as educators and thrive to expand their knowledge in their chosen disciplines.</p>
