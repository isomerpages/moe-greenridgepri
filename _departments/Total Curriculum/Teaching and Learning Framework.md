With the vision to develop each Greenridgean to be an Engaged Learner and Caring Leader, guided by the school values of Integrity, Graciousness, Responsibility and Public-Spiritedness, the GRPS Total Curriculum Framework sets the direction for the implementation of the curriculum and co-curriculum for the holistic development of our students. 

We seek to develop the values, disposition and skills that will prepare and enable our students to be ready for the future.
