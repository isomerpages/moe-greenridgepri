With the vision to develop each Greenridgean to be an Engaged Learner and Caring Leader, guided by the school values of Integrity, Graciousness, Responsibility and Public-Spiritedness, the GRPS Total Curriculum Framework sets the direction for the implementation of the curriculum and co-curriculum for the holistic development of our students. 

We seek to develop the values, disposition and skills that will prepare and enable our students to be ready for the future.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Greenridge Primary School has a culture of Open Classrooms. Lead and senior teachers invite fellow teachers into their classrooms to observe their lessons. These sessions lead to meaningful discussions on teaching and learning matters, and in the open sharing of classroom practices.&nbsp;The sessions allow teachers to reflect with one another on the way they teach and how students learn better. The teachers in the school are models of continuous lifeâ€“long learning. They take pride in upgrading their skills as educators and thrive to expand their knowledge in their chosen disciplines.</p>
