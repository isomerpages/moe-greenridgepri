# Student Leadership
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Greenridge Primary School, we believe that every child is a leader, as imbibed by the school’s vision of ‘Engaged Learners, Caring Leaders’. Our intent is to develop principles-centred students who continue to learn independently and collaboratively in school and beyond. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our students are driven by their sense of responsibility and public-spiritedness to come forth to lead – graciously caring for those that they lead. They lead humbly, never asking anything in return for their deeds and actions. Thus, through the our Student Leadership Initiatives, we hope to nurture in our students engaged learners, caring leaders who are grounded in values and equipped with the competencies to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Student Leadership Model </b></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In support of the school’s vision, the department has adopted Kouzes and Posner’s (2005) Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership as outcomes for the GRPS Student Leadership Programme. Through the programme, we aim to inculcate in our student leaders the following 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership:</p>

*   To have the confidence to Model the Way
*   To lead others by Inspiring a Shared Vision
*   To have courage to Challenge the Process
*   To foster collaboration that Enable Others to Act
*   To have the passion to Encourage the Heart

Above all, we expect them to lead with an&nbsp;**Others-Centric**&nbsp;mindset: to put others before themselves in their leadership journey.

The five practices translate into the following student commitment or behavior indicators as defined by Kouzes and Posner:

| Practices                | Commitment or Behaviour Indicators                                                                                                                                             |
|:--------------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      ***Model the Way***      | Find your voice by clarifying your personal values. <br><br>Set the example by aligning actions with shared values.                                                                |
| ***Inspired a Shared Vision*** | Envision the future by imagining exciting and ennobling activities. <br><br>Enlist others in a common vision by appealing to shared aspirations.                                   |
|   ***Challenge the Process***  | Search for opportunities by seeking innovative ways to change, grow and improve. <br><br>Experiment and take risks by constantly generating small wins and learning from mistakes. |
|   ***Enable Others to Act***   | Foster collaboration by promoting cooperative goals and building trust. <br><br>Strengthen others by sharing power and discretion.           |
|    ***Encourage the Heart***   | Recognise contributions by showing appreciation for individual excellence.           |

To maximize leadership opportunities, our students across all levels have three avenues in which to they are given the chance to develop their leadership skills.&nbsp;

These three avenues are in the classroom, in their respective CCAs, as well as through the Prefectorial Board.

<p style="text-align: justify;">On 20th April 2017, a group of prefects armed with thongs and garbage bags went around the neighbourhood on foot to show their support for this litter picking activity. Though it was a hot and humid afternoon, but our prefects’ spirits were high. They had so much fun in the process but more importantly, they learnt the importance of keeping our living environment clean and litter free.</p>

<b><u>Kindergarten Visit</u></b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our prefects helped to usher and act as guides during the kindergarten visit on 18th May 2017. They brought the different groups of children to tour around the school and gave them a brief introduction of the various special rooms in the school compound. Some of our prefects even prepared stickers to give to the young visitors. It had been a memorable experience for our prefects</p>  

<b><u>Values Brief by Prefects</u></b>&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every week, prefects will take turn to share with the other pupils on values of the week. These presentations will be done every Tuesday and Wednesday before assembly programme. The Powerpoint slides and scripts are prepared by them based on their understanding of the values that can be found in every pupil’s handbook.</p>
