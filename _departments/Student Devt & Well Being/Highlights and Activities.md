<b><u>Pre Assembly Social Talks</u></b>

Pre-assembly social skills talks are conducted for P1 to P4 students every week.&nbsp;Students will be equipped with skills to relate with their peers more positively, enhancing social cohesion. When the environment is positive, students will be able to manage academic stress better. Students with challenges can then become better learners when their social and emotional needs are addressed.

<b><u>R.I.S.E &amp; Shine Programme</u></b>

The R.I.S.E &amp; Shine Programme started in 2014 as a prototype 9-week research and evidence-based pilot project, for Primary 4 students to cultivate resilience in them. The programme encompasses of 7 interactive and engaging sessions where pupils learn skills to build resilience through hands-on activities,&nbsp;a learning journey to meet successful and resilient individuals&nbsp;and a&nbsp;graduation ceremony to render appreciation to participants.

This programme was designed based on a publication, “A Guide to Promoting Resilience in Children: Strengthening the Human Spirit” from the International Resilience Project and a book, “The Optimistic Child” by Dr Martin Seligman.&nbsp;Based on Dr Edith Grotberg’s research, children who are resilient have three key resilient promoting factors in their lives, which are incorporated into the programme as stepping stones to achieve the objective of cultivating resilience in these students.&nbsp;

The R.I.S.E &amp; Shine Programme is still ongoing in school with the support of the pupils, teachers and parents. The programme hopes to walk through similar journeys with more students in the future to maximise their potential and ensure that they “Rise and Shine”.

<b><u>Prefects’ Investiture</u></b>

The Prefectorial Board is the pinnacle leadership development body in the school and its purpose is to identify, develop and nurture students who have the potential to be among the top echelon of the student leadership body. 

They are given opportunities to be actively involved and engaged in various aspects of school administration as well leading student service learning initiatives in the school with the aim of grooming them into excellent service leaders.  
  
A group of newly selected Primary 3 – Primary 5 prefects and all current prefects will undergo the Prefects’ Investiture yearly. It was during the investiture that the prefects had the honour to have their ties/vests put on by the teachers on stage with pride.
