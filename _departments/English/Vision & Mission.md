### Vision
  
The English Language and Social Studies Department strives to build a strong foundation in the English Language for all students. We seek to develop empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers so that our students will become confident and articulate users of the English Language.  
  

### Mission

The English Language and Social Studies Department aims to help students grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and the world in which we live in. We endeavor for students to become informed, concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live
