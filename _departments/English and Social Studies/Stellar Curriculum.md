<p style="text-align: justify;">The shared experiences provided the context and content for the children to think and talk about. With the help of the teacher who transcribes the children's input, the students come up with a piece of class writing. This will become the basis for group writing, when the children work in small groups, before they go on to individual writing.</p>

**Sustained Silent Reading (SSR)**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) is a regularly scheduled, fixed period of time in which everyone in the room reads a book of his/her choice quietly and without any interruptions. It encourages the students to develop a love for reading.</p>

**Book Talk**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of formative assessment, primary 3 students do a Book Talk on their favourite book. It gives them an opportunity to share about their favourite books with their classmates and also builds their confidence in public speaking.</p>

**Primary 5 and 6**

**Global Awareness Programme**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Primary 4, 5 and 6 students subscribe to the Little Red Dot (LRD) yearly. It is to inculcate the habit of reading newspapers from young and to expose them to news and current events, with elements of social emotional learning, values education and National Education. Teachers will use the newspaper articles to lead the class in discussions about the values that are reflected in the articles. After the discussion, students will have to write a reflection on their takeaway and moral stand on the issues discussed. Each term, the English Department will focus on 2 core values.</p>

The core values are as follows:-

|         School Term 1        |              School Term 2              |      School Term 3     |
|:----------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| Integrity and Responsibility | Graciousness and<br><br>Public-spiritedness | Harmony and Resilience |


<p style="text-align: justify;">Selected pieces are displayed on the notice board in the Quiet Zone. This is to showcase the students’ boundless creativity and to stimulate them to think about what they can do to make our society a better place for all.</p>
