# Parents' Workshops

<p style="text-align: justify;"> During the yearly Parent-Teacher Meetings and Conferences, our experienced English Language teachers conduct workshops for parents. Parents learn the strategies that their children are learning in school. Armed with these strategies, they will be better able to assist their children in their school work.</p>
