<p style="text-align: justify;">NUS High School of Mathematics and Science organizes the NUS High Oratorical Challenge yearly to offer a unique experience where upper primary students compete in delivering both fictional and information/scientific speeches.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2021, our students, Anton Chia and Navya Natarajaperumal, worked very hard for the Oratorical Challenge and were given the Commendation Award. Watch their videos as they share on their thoughts and feelings on joining the NUS High Oratorical Challenge.</p>

**Moo-O Awards**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">For two consecutive years, the students have taken part in the Moo-O Awards. In this competition, students are expected to write a script and create a video based on a story. The students had a whale of a time producing their video clips.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlene Ng Yu Hui (6 Humility), Naomi Tanzil (6Humilty), Tay Tghee Khee (6 Humility), James Ang Jun Jie (6 Respect) and Ong Eugene (6 Humility) took part in the Wits and Words 2016, organized by the Curriculum Planning and Development Division, MOE.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The debate team was guided by Mdm Harpal Kaur and Justin Lau, an ex- Greenridgean. Justin has been leading the debate team for several years.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the first round, the team was up against Canberra Primary School. Unfortunately, we were defeated. However that did not dampen our spirits. In the face of defeat, it strengthened our resolve and we managed to beat Bukit Panjang Primary in the second round.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were also emerged as the winners in the third round against Balestier Primary. Furthermore, Naomi Tanzil and Tghee Khee were voted as Best Speakers by the judges.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The debaters accomplished great achievements despite the short period of time we were given to prepare the topics. It was truly an outstanding accomplishment. Kudos to all!</p>
