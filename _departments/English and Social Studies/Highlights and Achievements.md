NUS High School of Mathematics and Science organizes the NUS High Oratorical Challenge yearly to offer a unique experience where upper primary students compete in delivering both fictional and information/scientific speeches. 

In 2021, our students, Anton Chia and Navya Natarajaperumal, worked very hard for the Oratorical Challenge and were given the Commendation Award. Watch their videos as they share on their thoughts and feelings on joining the NUS High Oratorical Challenge.
