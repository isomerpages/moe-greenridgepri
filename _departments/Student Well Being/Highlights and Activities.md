**Pre Assembly Social Talks**

Pre-assembly social skills talks are conducted for P1 to P4 students every week.Â Students will be equipped with skills to relate with their peers more positively, enhancing social cohesion. When the environment is positive, students will be able to manage academic stress better. Students with challenges can then become better learners when their social and emotional needs are addressed.
