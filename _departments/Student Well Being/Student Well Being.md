# Student Well-Being

**The Student Well-Being Department** undertakes to nurture Social and Emotional competencies, strengthen positive Teacher Student Relationship and promote the mental well-being of students within a caring and supportive learning and school environment, involving all teachers. To facilitate the acquisition of SE competencies, our school has used a variety of existing platforms:


\-  The explicit teaching of SEL as part of the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE); and through Guidance Areas which include Education and Career Guidance, Sexuality Education and the Cyber Wellness curriculum;  
\-  The infusion of SEL into existing academic curriculum;  
\-  The use of teaching approaches that require students to apply social and emotional competencies, for example, group work and cooperative learning; and  
\-  The informal curriculum, for example, CCA, outdoors education and specific school programme like leadership programmes and camps.  
\-  To strengthen Teacher Student Relationship, our school has adopted various strategies to focus on the mentor teacher concept so that more attention will be given to individual students throughout their primary school life under the PERI recommendations. In addition, the formation of the Student Development Team and the introduction of the Year Heads in our school since 2015 has further strengthen our school’s capacity to know and cater to the needs of students.
