### Positive Discipline (Chapter Summary)


<u>Positive Discipline in the Classroom<br>By Jane Nelson<br>Chapter 1 (a summary by Mdm Jannah)<br>An Encouragement Model</u>

“A child needs encouragement like a plant needs water. It is essential to healthy growth and development. “   
– Rudolf Dreikurs

Positive Discipline consists of methods that involve students in focusing on solutions instead of being the recipients of punishments and rewards. 

Positive Discipline will make your life easier. Really! If you are a kind and firm teacher who focuses on academics along with teaching social and emotional skills, you are already on board. 

Positive Discipline – trained teachers create classrooms where young people are treated with respect, have the courage and excitement to love learning, and have the opportunity to learn the skills they need for a successful life.

The Positive Discipline vision is about schools where children never experience humiliation when they fail but instead feel empowered by the opportunity to learn from their mistakes in a safe environment.

Three Empowering Beliefs that Help Children Succeed in School and in Life :   
I am capable.   
I contribute in meaningful ways, and I am genuinely needed.   
I use my personal power to make choices that positively influence what happens to me and my community.

Four Empowering Skills that Help Children Succeed in School and in Life :   
I have discipline and self-control.   
I can work respectfully with others.   
I understand how my behaviour affects others.   
I can develop wisdom and judgment skills through daily practice.

Positive Discipline is effective when teachers are willing to give up control over students and instead work with them in a cooperative manner. 

Teachers who learn how to ask more questions and give fewer lectures develop a real curiosity about their students’ thoughts and opinions.

When students are encouraged to express their opinions, are given choices instead of edicts, and use group problem solving, the classroom atmosphere improves and becomes one of cooperation, collaboration, and mutual respect.

<u>Positive Discipline in the Classroom<br>By Jane Nelson<br>Chapter 2 (a summary by Ethan Yeo)<br>A Paradigm Shift</u>

Positive Discipline involves a world where teachers don’t use rewards and punishments. The focus becomes the solution to problems and instead of imposing consequences on students, teachers encourage students to think about the consequences of their behavior, and how it affects them and others.

Teachers accustomed to discipline programs based of behaviourism would require a paradigm shift  in their awareness.

In Positive Discipline, kids are invited to think about what to do. Studies have shown that telling usually creates a physiological resistance in the body. The message that is sent to the brain is Resist. By contrast, respectfully asking creates a physiological relaxation of the body, and the message that is sent to the brain is Search for an answer.  

Examples.  
What do you need to  bring to be prepared for class?  
Instead of…  
You know you should have your books and homework ready before you come to class!

What is your plan for getting work your work done before class is over?   
Instead of…   
If you don’t get your work done in class, you’ll stay in from recess and get it done then!

  

THE ICEBERG ANALOGY OF HUMAN BEHAVIOUR   
Positive discipline not  only addresses the tip of the iceberg but also the underwater portion.   
Children who misbehave are children who are discouraged. When we address only the behaviour (the part we see) that is only the tip of the iceberg.  We call the part that is hidden under the surface the “belief behind the behaviour.”

UNDERSTANDING THE UNDERWATER PART OF THE ICEBERG   
Children continuously make subconscious decisions about themselves based on perceptions, or private logic, of their life experiences. Children are not aware they are making these decisions. When children feel safe – when they feel that they belong and are significant – they thrive. They develop into capable people with the characteristics and life skills teachers want them to have.   
We believe that the long-term result of using punishments and rewards to motivate behaviour is discouragement. The long term results of punishment are described as follows:

  

Three R’s of Punishment:   
1\. Rebellion. “They can’t make me. I’ll do what I want.”   
2\. Revenge. “I’ll get even and hurt back, even if it hurts my future.”   
3\. Retreat:   
a. Low self-esteem: “I must be a bad person.”   
b. Sneaky: “I just won’t get caught next time.”


This book is filled with alternatives. If we were to choose just one alternative to a punitive or reward system, it would be to ask a student who is behaving improperly, “How can we solve this problem?” This helps them feel feel capable and teaches them to focus on solutions to mistakes.
