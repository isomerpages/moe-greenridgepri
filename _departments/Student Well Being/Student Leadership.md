# Student Leadership
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Greenridge Primary School, we believe that every child is a leader, as imbibed by the school’s vision of ‘Engaged Learners, Caring Leaders’. Our intent is to develop principles-centred students who continue to learn independently and collaboratively in school and beyond. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our students are driven by their sense of responsibility and public-spiritedness to come forth to lead – graciously caring for those that they lead. They lead humbly, never asking anything in return for their deeds and actions. Thus, through the our Student Leadership Initiatives, we hope to nurture in our students engaged learners, caring leaders who are grounded in values and equipped with the competencies to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.</p>

In support of the school’s vision, the department has adopted Kouzes and Posner’s (2005) Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership as outcomes for the GRPS Student Leadership Programme. Through the programme, we aim to inculcate in our student leaders the following 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership:

*   To have the confidence to Model the Way
*   To lead others by Inspiring a Shared Vision
*   To have courage to Challenge the Process
*   To foster collaboration that Enable Others to Act
*   To have the passion to Encourage the Heart

Above all, we expect them to lead with an **Others-Centric** mindset: to put others before themselves in their leadership journey.

The five practices translate into the following student commitment or behavior indicators as defined by Kouzes and Posner:
