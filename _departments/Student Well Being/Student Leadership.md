# Student Leadership
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Greenridge Primary School, we believe that every child is a leader, as imbibed by the school’s vision of ‘Engaged Learners, Caring Leaders’. Our intent is to develop principles-centred students who continue to learn independently and collaboratively in school and beyond. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our students are driven by their sense of responsibility and public-spiritedness to come forth to lead – graciously caring for those that they lead. They lead humbly, never asking anything in return for their deeds and actions. Thus, through the our Student Leadership Initiatives, we hope to nurture in our students engaged learners, caring leaders who are grounded in values and equipped with the competencies to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.</p>
