### Commemorating NE Core events

<u><b>1) Total Defence Day</b></u>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of the event was to highlight the fall of Singapore to Japanese forces 74 years ago and the suffering the local population went through for the next three and a half years. A series of activities were organised for children to participate and learn from the different experiences. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to TDD, classroom activities were organised for pupils to come up with haikus expressing their love for Singapore and how they will defend it. Pupils learnt how to prepare their own ready bag in an emergency situation. Pupils were also given the ‘Family Time Card’ that created opportunities for parents to talk about total defence with their children and what they must do as a family in an emergency.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the actual day, pupils had an assembly talk that highlighted the main events that happened 74 years ago and on the importance of the five aspects of total defence. During recess, pupils experienced eating rice porridge with sweet potatoes - the same food that people ate during the Japanese occupation. As part of recess activities, the pupils learnt how to dress small cuts and wounds, perform the “Stop, Drop and Roll” as part of a drill should their clothes catch fire. Pupils also contributed recyclables to show how they can play a part for a sustainable Singapore.</p>
