<u><b>Journey to the True Heart (JTTH)</b></u>

JTTH is the school’s flagship programme to inculcate good values and character in pupils. Primary to Primary 4 pupils are given a ‘bear card’ at the beginning of the year. When children display positive values or behaviours, they are given bear stickers to reaffirm their good behaviour. 

As for the Primary 5 and 6 pupils, they are issued with a Values Advocate Card with pre-existing tasks. Upper primary pupils are encouraged to explicitly display positive values and behaviours and advocate it to their fellow friend and family at home.
