# Art Curriculum
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary art education programme is to enable every child to be visually literate and to appreciate art from a personal, cultural and communicative point of view.   This curriculum framework focuses on developing pupils’ sensory awareness, imagination and visual inquiry skills to investigate their surroundings as subject matter. They also will acquire creative art-making skills that enable them to share their ideas, thoughts and feelings. They will acquire visual literacy skills that enable them to describe and interpret artworks from a variety of cultures and context.   Pupils will be able to interpret, create and select images to convey ideas. Art beautifies our world, captures memories, communicates ideas, imparts values and evokes emotions. It also reflects cultures and beliefs. Sharing of ideas and learning about artworks made by different people provide a platform to develop our pupils’ understanding of cultures and different perception.   The overview of the syllabus content provides diversity and breadth for schools to customise the content in the instructional programme according to students’ learning style and abilities and implement knowledge, skills and values that pupils will acquire to achieve the learning outcomes. One of the strategy used in art lesson is using the Art Inquiry Model, it consists of five inquiry steps: Connect & Wonder, Investigate, Make, Express, and Reflect. The Art Inquiry Model guides the lesson planning by providing a structure to teach methods and skills, or for pupils to demonstrate skills related to visual inquiry, research and communication. As pupils recognize the important role of art and its relevance in their everyday life, they would begin to value art as an important component in our experiences.</p>
