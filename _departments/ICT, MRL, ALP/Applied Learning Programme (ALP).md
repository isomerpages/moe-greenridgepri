# Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

<b><u>Vision</u></b>

To prepare Greenridgeans to become computational thinkers who understand how today’s digital tools can help solve tomorrow’s problems.  

<b><u>Mission</u></b>

To develop empathetic, resilient solvers through computational thinking and coding.  

<b><u>Our Journey</u></b>
  
For this year, our Primary 2 students completed a 1-day Learn to Code with Scratch Jr conducted by our teachers. The students learnt to make a simple Mathematics game.  
  
In 2020, we prototyped our Applied Learning Programme (ALP). We adopted a tiered approach. We continue to use Hour of Code for our Primary 1 to 5 students to introduce basic coding. Our Primary 3 students had a 1-day Learn to Code with Scratch as part of the end of year post exam activity taught by our own teachers. Our Primary 6 students are onboard the Code for Fun Programme by IMDA too.
