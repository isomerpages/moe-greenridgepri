This year's theme for Cyber Wellness week was Cyberbullying - Online harassment has an off line impact. Cyberbullying has been on the rise and the effects of cyberbullying can be detrimental and lifelong for the victims. To curb the negative effects and stamp out cyberbullying from Greenridge Primary School, the teachers were equipped to handle cyberbullying cases. A  sharing session was conducted for the teachers to look out for signs that a student is being cyberbullied and how to take corrective action. To take a step further and stop cyberbullying from even occurring, the teachers were also taught on how to identify cyberbullies and how to counsel these students. With the students heightened awareness of cyberbullying, teachers and parents playing a more active role in looking out for the warning signs, cyberbullies will have no place in our school. Let's be the change.
