<b><u>About the Game</u></b>

C-Quest is specially designed to facilitate meaningful parent-child conversations on their online experiences and explore various cyber wellness issues in order to navigate the cyber space safely and responsibly.

The game is meant for parents with children aged 10 to 14. To complete the cyber quest, children have to converse with their parents and answer questions related to cyber wellness to earn stars and collect accessories and equipment for their Cyber Navigators.

The game also provides useful tips to the players to manage their online activities. These questions and tips are aligned to the Cyber Wellness lessons in the Form Teacher Guidance Period and the CCE Cyber Wellness Guidance Module. Where opinions differ, the game provides opportunities for the players to talk about their differences and understand how others may feel or think.

C-Quest is available on Google Play now. iOS version will be available by 1 Nov 2014.
