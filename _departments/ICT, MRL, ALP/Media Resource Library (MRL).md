In Greenridge Primary School, the Media Resource Library (MRL) actively promotes the Joy of Reading and wants each and every student to be a strong reader and a lifelong learner. It also aims to play a key role in developing 21st Century Competencies in our students and has been evolving in many ways to cater to our digital readers.  
  
We have put in place, structures and initiatives to foster a strong reading culture in our school. As we want to work closely with parents to inculcate the love for reading, please do take note of the following library matters and programmes that would require your kind attention.  
  
<u><b>Library Matters</b></u>  

**1\. LAUNCH OF ‘THE BOOK LOFT’ (MINI LIBRARY) AND READING CORNER**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with our mission to promote a strong reading culture in GRPS, the English Department has created a ‘Book Loft’ at the ground floor of our school. It is at an accessible location, just behind the canteen, where all students will find it convenient to read and borrow books. The Book Loft can house up to 2500 English and Mother Tongue (Fiction and Non-Fiction) books and magazines. There is also a separate reading corner, built near the parade square, furnished with books, magazines and newspapers for students to read at their own leisure. Please see pictures below:</p>

**2.** **BOOK TALKS AND MASS BORROWING SESSIONS (NLB)**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">To encourage our students to read more widely, our school is partnering the <b>National Library Board (NLB)</b> in 2 key programmes, <b>Book Talk and Mass Borrowing.</b></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Book Talk or Book Buzz</u></b> – A librarian from National Library Board (NLB) will give a book talk in the school for the P1-6 students and this book talk covers book recommendations based on a particular theme. Students are able to borrow the books or books of similar genre mentioned during the book talks immediately after the book talks in the school library.</p>

<u><b>Mass Borrowing</b></u> \- Usually the book talks will be followed by the NLB mass borrowing programme. NLB will bring thousands of their books to our school and all our students will have the opportunity to borrow the books without the need to travel to any of the NLB libraries.  

To enable your child / ward to borrow the books during the NLB Mass Borrowing sessions, we would need the support of the parents to ensure that your child brings the **Student Concession Card** i.e. **Ezlink Card (with photo)** or **NLB library card** during the scheduled Mass Borrowing dates to school.

**3\. COMPUTERS IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY & OPAC**

Computers are available in the library for students to use for their school work and projects. They can also use the computers to access OPAC (Online Public Access Catalogue) to search for the availability of the books in the school libraries and check if they have any overdue books.  
  
They can also read and write book reviews, look out for book recommendations and find out more information about the books they are interested in. OPAC can be accessed from home too:

***Borrower ID or Username: Student’s BC number***  
***Password: MOE@DDMMYYYY where DDMMYYYY is the student’s date of birth.***
  
***Kindly take note that there will be a password change upon first login*** 
  

**4.** **LIBRARY PROGRAMMES**

<b><u>Reading</u></b>

Our focus for Reading Fest will revolve around different genres of books, local writers, values and library skills. Students work in groups to read for information and will be involved in various activities like quizzes, crossword puzzles, book hunt, etc. There will also be SLS lessons assigned to all students during Reading Fests.

<b><u>5. Pocket-Sized Programme (Monthly Thematic Book Displays) and Other Displays Linked to Festivals/Cultures in Singapore.</u></b>

Every month, our librarian would prepare book displays and activities linked to different exciting topics or themes e.g. Chinese New Year, Know Your Library, Get to Know OPAC, Books to Movies, Racial Harmony Day, Discovering Genres and etc.  
  
These book displays help to boost pupils’ interest in the different themes and genres of books and expose them to the new and current collections in the library. The displays also convey meaningful information about the topics/themes.
