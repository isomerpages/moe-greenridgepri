### **Students in Action**

**Maths and Science Week @ GRPS**

During this exciting week, pupils from Primary 1 to Primary 6 had a chance to have a ‘Math Dual’ with a friend and take part in a Science Quiz via IPADs during their recesses The pupils found it exciting to challenge one another in their addition and multiplication skills and were seen doing competitive mental sums. The Science quiz being visually engaging even attracted the Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils to attempt the quiz. It was truly an exciting recess for all the pupils with math and science posters, experiments, demonstrations and technology side by side.
