# Parent Support Group
<b><u>Chairman Speech</u></b>

Welcome to Greenridge Primary School’s Parent Support Group (PSG) webpage!  
  
The ‘Parents-In-Action-Greenridgeans-Excel-Together’ (PIAGET) comprises of ex and current parents of Greenridge Primary School’s students. We are a community of parents who strongly believe that our involvement in school events, programmes and activities will enrich the educational experiences for our children. Our objective is to foster a close partnership with the school to provide a holistic and conducive environment for our children to grow, learn and develop. PIAGET also serves as a support platform for parents to network and share parenting experiences to help one another.  
  
We are incredibly fortunate to have GRPS’s school leaders and teachers who have been warmly receptive to our suggestions, concerns and feedback. The school is also very supportive and proactive in organizing talks and activities alongside with the PSG. The PSG members have collaborated with the school to come up with parent created segments during Racial Harmony Day and Children’s Day. Such partnership is necessary, as both the school and GRPS parents have shared interests and responsibilities to help our children enjoy, excel and realize their full potential.  
  
As part of our continuing efforts to strengthen our team, we would like to welcome more parents to join PIAGET to participate or volunteer in school activities. Parents are welcome to help and contribute with their knowledge, time and area of expertise. So, together in alliance with our children’s educators, please join us as a volunteer to participate in upcoming events, activities and workshops by registering here.  
  
Lastly, a big thank you to the school leaders, teachers and parent volunteers for your continued support to ensure the success of PIAGET.  
  
  
Best Regards,  
Ian Tan  
Chairman  
PIAGET – Parents’ Support Group
