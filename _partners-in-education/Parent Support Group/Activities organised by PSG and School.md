# Activities organised by PSG and School

<b><u>Parenting Talks & Parent-Child Bonding Activities</u></b>

Every year, the school organises a series of parenting talks to equip parents with knowledge and skills in good parenting. So far, three parenting talks have been organised this year. They were on EQ parenting, how to guide your child to navigate safely in the cyberworld and how can parents create a conducive environment to maximise their children’s learning potential.

Besides parenting talk, the school and PSG organises fun-filled activities aimed at bonding parents with their children. Some of the past events organised include invitation to attend National Day, premier movie screening, camping at Underwater World, sandcastle building, bowling, bubble soccer and an amazing race at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
