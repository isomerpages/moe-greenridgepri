# Greenridge QR Code
Our school leaders with the Greenridge QR Code andÂ [Positive Education Framework](https://greenridgepri-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/departments/student-well-being/student-well-being)

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Greenridge QR Code is a large QR code installation that links to our school website in celebration of our 25th Anniversary. It is a 2.1m x 2.1m artwork done by students & teachers. With covid-19 wreaking, touch-free powered solutions with QR Codes have come to our rescue. The black pixels are celebratory messages written by our students. The colourful canvases acts like confetti; a representation of the vibrancy & special moments that Greenridgeans have experienced for the past 25 years.</p>
