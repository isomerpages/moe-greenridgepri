**2. In the event parents are unable to purchase the new uniform in end-December before school opens, what alternative do affected students have?**

The new uniform for 2024 P1 students will be in stock in end-December. Affected students who may require exceptional sizes that may not be catered for by the uniform vendor, may have their uniform order customized by the vendor. For such students, they may be allowed to loan out old school uniform from the school general office to wear during the first few days of school in 2024.

**3. Will P1 students be allowed to wear the uniform that was handed down from older siblings?**

All 2024 P1 students are required to wear the new school uniform, and the transition will progressively take place over the next 5 years until the whole student population wears the new school uniform. Thus P1 students are not allowed to wear old uniform from older siblings.

**4. Must P2-P6 students buy the new school uniform?**

2024 P2-P6 students can continue to wear their existing formal uniform attire, and PE attire (i.e.  colored t-shirt and PE shorts) until they graduate.

**5. Can 2024 P2 – P6 students buy the new uniform?**

2024 P2 – P6 students can purchase the new uniform, if they wish to wear the new uniform top (and for girls, the new skorts).

**6. Can P2-P6 students still use the old PE attire or they need to buy the new PE attire?**

In 2024, P2-P6 students can still continue to wear their old PE attire (comprising the colored t-shirt and PE shorts). They do not need to buy new PE attire. The uniform vendor is still selling the current colored PE t-shirt for the P2-P6 students.

**7. Why is there no more house system, and no more need for house t-shirt colors?**

The school moved away from having sports activities based on house colors, instead these are now at intra or inter-class level or mass participation. With this shift, as seen in 2023's Lower Primary Sports Carnival, students had more opportunities to be involved in more activities, rather than house-based. This also benefits parents with more than 1 child as there is no longer a need to buy different colored t-shirts for each child who may be in different houses.

In addition, with effect from 2024, the school is moving to colored name tags by levels, where the colored name tags will follow the students until they graduate. Removing house color t-shirts reduces fabric wastage (and in turn encourages recycling) by having one school top of the same color.

**8. Since there will be no house colors with the new uniform, how will this affect PE activities?**

PE activities will not be affected due to changes in the new uniform. The new uniform top serves dual purpose for daily wear and for PE lessons due to the breathability and moisture wicking material. House colors have been phased out.

**9. Will there be flexibility for students to continue to wear PE attire instead of regular uniform as per 2023 announcement?**

The current practice of wearing either formal uniform or PE attire will continue for 2024 P2-P6 students who have both the formal uniform and PE attire sets. This is to ensure the comfort and well-being of our students.

**10. Is there a plan for recycling old uniform?**

Parents are welcome to donate cleaned old school uniform that are still in very good condition, to the school general office. The school will keep these uniforms for purposes such as providing temporary wear for students who may have accidentally stained their uniform while in school.
