#### **Student Care Centre**

##### **Star Campus @ Greenridge Primary**

The school-based student care centre (SCC) is available only to
pupils of Greenridge Primary School. The SCC aims to provide a
safe, structured and conducive environment for rest and learning
after school hours. Pupils in SCC will have many opportunities to
develop social and emotional competencies and foster positive
relationships with others.

As part of the daily SCC programme, pupils will also have
structured time and a conducive environment to complete
homework assigned by school. However, do note that SCC does
not provide academic support programmes, which are instead
carried out by pupilsâ€™ respective academic subject teachers.
The SCC service provider at Greenridge Primary School is Star
Campus Pte Ltd. For any clarifications on programmes,
services and fees, kindly contact:
