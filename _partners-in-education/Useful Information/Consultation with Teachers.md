# Consultation with Teachers
Parents or Guardians who wish to meet up with the teachers for matters pertaining to their children are encouraged to call or **[email](mailto:grps@moe.edu.sg)** the General Office to make an appointment with the teacher. This is to ensure that parents do not make unfruitful trips should the teachers they wish to meet are conducting lessons in class or are not available.

Note:

*   Include the child's name and class for reference purposes
*   Leave a contact number
