# Basketball
### Introduction

Basketball is a sport that can inculcate teamwork, discipline and sportsmanship. It is also a sport that can improve physical health and strength. 

Our structured training programme teaches our pupils basic skills and rules of the game. Pupils with potential or outstanding performance will represent our school for competition.  Intensive training will be provided to deepen the players’ skills and knowledge of the game. 

Our MOE certified coach, Mr Tee, has years of experience coaching schools of different levels and represented schools and clubs as captain of the basketball teams. He was a member of the National Basketball Team previously as well. 

We have been participating in West Zone Basketball Tournament over the years and have won several awards. 

Our basketball players had also actively participated in school events like Children’s Day Celebration and Chinese New Year Celebration.

Our basketball boys who have excelled were talent scouted by secondary schools and some of them have the opportunity to continue to pursue their passion in the game and hone their basketball skills by joining some of these niche schools. In 2020, 2 of our boys were selected by Jurong Secondary School and Unity Secondary School through the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise.
