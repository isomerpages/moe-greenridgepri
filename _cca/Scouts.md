### Introduction

Cub Scouts are boys and girls between the ages of seven and twelve and a half. The objective of the Cub Scouts program is to provide a group environment, which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the child’s basic need to face and overcome challenges. Self-developmental activities are well-entrenched components of the overall drive towards encouraging “Fun & Discovery” amongst the Cubs.  

The activities are based on the natural sense of fun and enthusiasm of the age group and thus the training is achieved largely through games, interaction in small groups and activities.

Starting from this early development stages, Cub Scouts will aim to earn a series of Badges, which give them a knowledge of basic Scouting skills and mark achievements in areas such as campcraft, air and water activities, citizenship and improving the environment.

The Cub Scouts Section Training Scheme is divided into 3 progress badges and a highest award:

* Bronze Arrow
* Silver Arrow
* Gold Arrow
* Akela Award

Each progress badge comprises tests for Citizenship, Leadership and Responsibility, Physical Skills, Self-Reliance, Adventure and Fun.

The highest award in this section is the Akela Award, where a Cub Scout must hold the Gold Arrow and pass specific proficiency badges, show general knowledge of scouting and successfully complete an interview with the Area Commissioner.
