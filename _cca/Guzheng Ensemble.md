# Guzheng Ensemble

The Guzheng Ensemble CCA is not a new CCA group in GRPS. We had Guzheng Ensemble CCA many years ago. The Guzheng Ensemble aims to strive to inculcate a deeper artistic appreciation for the 2500-year-old traditional Chinese instrument as well as its History since ancient China.    
  
As performing in an ensemble requires teamwork and perseverance, students build up their confidence, character and leadership skills. These translate into values such as tenacity and determination. Students will be given opportunities to perform for various school events and competitions.     
  
We welcome the groups of Primary 3 students who have interest to join our Guzheng Ensemble CCA during the CCA recruitment exercise.
