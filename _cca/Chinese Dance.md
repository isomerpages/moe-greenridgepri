# Chinese Dance

Chinese Dance CCA inculcates students’ love for Chinese dance and culture through the teaching of dance moves. In this CCA, students will develop self-discipline, perseverance, commitment, and learn the importance of team work through rigorous trainings.

Our Chinese dance members have participated in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) in 2016 and 2018, and had done our school proud by clinching the Certificate of Accomplishment.
