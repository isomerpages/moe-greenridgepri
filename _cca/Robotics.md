### Introduction

Robotics in education provides an inter-disciplinary and problem-based learning experience.  
  
Pupils will undergo a series of interesting and fun filled activities in our highly creative and structured learning programme. They will be immersed in a world of Mathematics, Science and IT using robots as a tool for exploration and development.  
  
Constructionism is the key in this powerful learning environment where students can excel in creating and constructing ideas. They will be able to express their complex and innovative ideas and progressively build their self-confidence and “Mindstorm” skills.
