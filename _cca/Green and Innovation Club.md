# Green and Innovation Club

<b><u>Introduction</u></b>

The Green & Innovation Club is a place for students to showcase their love for the environment using creative ideas. Our main goal is to nurture our members into confident and self-directed learners. We aspire our members to become concerned citizens of the world who can actively take actions to make the world a better place.
