The 59J Boys’ and  59th Girls’ Brigades in Greenridge Primary School are uniformed groups that aim to nurture and develop boys and girls to reach their fullest potential based on values of reverence, self-respect, self-control, responsibility and discipline.

The overall programme for both Boys’ & Girls’ Brigades @ GRPS focus in providing fun and meaningful and challenging activities. From learning drills, attending camps, earning badges to serving the community, the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigades @ GRPS develop each child to have a heart and mind tuned to the school’s values of Integrity, Graciousness, Responsibility and Public-Spiritedness.

Each Brigade has its badge work and awards programme to follow:

We have rolled out the new Badge Work curriculum which was implemented in 2014. It focuses on four main objectives: **Global Awareness, Community Spiritedness, Personal Mastery and Leadership.**  

Each of these objectives will be covered in 4 lessons for every level, out of which 1 lesson will include a **Special Missions** card which they would be required to complete in order to show that they have successfully understood the unit objective. In order to attain a coloured badge, Boys must complete the series of activities and challenges set out in the Badge Work curriculum.
