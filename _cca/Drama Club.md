# Drama Club
### Introduction

<p style="text-align: center;"><i><b>“All the world’s a stage,<br>
And all the men and women merely players:  <br>
They have their exits and their entrances; …” </b><br><br>
William Shakespeare</i></p>

Drama Club is a great place for pupils to engage in acting, play-writing and showcasing of individual talents. Our main goal is to nurture our members into confident and independent individuals. They will be trained in vocal projection, body language awareness, facial expressions and the use of space. The activities conducted during CCA will help them understand that they have to work cohesively as a team, and everyone has a vital part to play in ensuring the plays are staged successfully. This year, we have engaged the services of Learning Factory to enrich the Drama Lessons for our members!
