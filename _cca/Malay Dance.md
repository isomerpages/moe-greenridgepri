# Malay Dance

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“Bunga layu di dalam taman,<br> <br> Bunga ditanam di kawasan gurun.  <br> Warisan Melayu jangan ditinggalkan,  <br> Menjadi kebanggaan turun-temurun.”</i></p>

### Introduction

Uniquely rich in culture and aesthetics, the Malay Dance CCA provides a platform for our students to display their artistic abilities. The CCA group preserves tradition while still exposing students to critical skills required in the modern context. While educating students about the culture and tradition, we ensure that students will also be equipped with 21st Century Competencies through relationship building with their peers as well as, contributing back to the community.     
  
The GRPS Malay Dance clinched a Gold Award in the 2018 SYF Arts Presentation (Malay Dance Category). Through Malay Dance, we also hope to instill character and values such as respect and teamwork. We also aim to reach out to the community.    
  
 We are very proud of the dedication and positive attitude of out talented members. We look forward to soar higher with our team of dedicated members.
