# Art Expression Club

### Introduction

Our Art Expression Club members have continued to hone their skills a wide range of art making beyond the usual curriculum. Our members come in at all different art ability levels but the nature of art education allows them to take projects as far as they are capable of, such as in our wall mural painting (shown below). The club also endeavours to create immersive learning experiences through close looking and discussions about artworks. Pupils who are artistically more advanced were encouraged to progress to more in-depth directions depending on their areas of interest.  
  
**CCA Teachers in Charge:**  

*   Mr Tan Kah Keong (I/C)
*   Mdm Nurhudha (2 I/C)
*   Mdm Izyan
