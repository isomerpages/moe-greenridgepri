# Hockey
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Hockey CCA aims to nurture Resilient, Committed and Caring sports leaders who lead the way in all aspects of their lives.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through fun and engaging training sessions, students are able to develop Self-confidence & Teamwork, as well as improve on their technical, physical & mental skills.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students are also educated in the values of Sportsmanship and Excellence through opportunities such as friendly matches, competitions and VIA (Values-In-Action) experiences. We hope to inculcate passion and love for this beautiful game through our CCA!</p>
