# Sport Climbing
### Introduction

**Climbing** first became part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo 2021 where athletes competed in the 3 disciplines of leading, bouldering and speed climbing. Our students in GRPS also experience these 3 disciplines of climbing. The only difference is that leading is replaced by top-roping which is more age appropriate. Climbing is a sport which trains the social, emotional, physical and cognitive aspects of a person. To be a good climber, our student needs to be resilient and persevere through rigorous training of physical strength, flexibility and balance. The student must also stay focus in order to solve the puzzles represented by the climbing holds to eventually reach the top.  

In 2019, our climbers had the opportunity to participate in the annual National Primary Schools Sport Climbing Championships as well as the annual People’s Association Climbing Carnival. As commercial climbing gyms become more widespread across the island, our climbers also have more opportunities to participate in competitions organized by these climbing gyms and practice their skills.
