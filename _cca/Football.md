# Football
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of this CCA is to develop our students’ skills and passion in football with aspirations to become sports leaders with exemplary dispositions; exhibiting good sportsmanship and values of fair play, teamwork and discipline through playing football.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our GRPS Football teams consist of 3 groups: <b>Senior</b> School Team, <b>Junior</b> School Team and <b>Developmental</b> Team, to improve their individual technical skills, physical conditioning as well as to improve their understanding and appreciation of team play.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through football, our boys will embark on an enriching experience to develop character and resilience, while building camaraderie with like-minded football enthusiasts.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that the engagement in football will teach our boys more than the rules of play. More importantly, it provides them with tools that translate into other aspects of their life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides regular trainings, we organise friendly matches as well as ViA (Values-in-Action) experiences so that our boys will strive to become effective team players and influential leaders who exemplify integrity, discipline and true sportsmanship.</p>
