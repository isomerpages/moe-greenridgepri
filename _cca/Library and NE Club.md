# Library and NE Club

### Welcome!


At the Library and NE Club, we warmly welcome all book enthusiasts who would love to immerse themselves in the wonderful world of literature! At the same time, we also wish to inculcate the love for Singapore through many authentic library and NE activities. During the CCA, the teachers and the school librarian will train all students to become our very own GRPS school librarians. They will learn how to take care of the library, design book launches (to promote new books), advocate the love for reading to the whole school, conduct reading festivals and assist in all library duties. 

**Media Resource Library (MRL) @ the Olympia Block**
