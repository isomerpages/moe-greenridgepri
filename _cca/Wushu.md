# Wushu

Wushu club aims to promote the spirit of Wushu and is a sport of discipline. Through this sport, members learn how to keep their bodies fit, and at the same time, learn about the traditional Chinese martial art.  

When members have mastered a particular routine, they may be selected to compete in the annual local inter-school competition. Such competition encourages members to build their self-confidence and gives opportunity to our members to interact with the other schools' Wushu teams. Our Wushu members are also involved actively in various schools’ events and celebrations.

Wushu as a whole will help one to achieve excellence in: 

* The Physical Aspect: skills building, increased flexibility/ agility, improved stamina, better body co-ordination
* The Mental Aspect: developing self-confidence, building teamwork, enhancing memory and mental strength
* Character Development: promoting the values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony
