Greenridge Primary School (GRPS) began functioning in January 1995 to cater to the growing demand for primary schools in Bukit Panjang New Town. The school then had 8 classes of 285 primary one pupils housed in two different schools within the estate. In January 1996, 12 more classes were added and they were housed in another school in Chua Chu Kang New Town. The school moved into its current site at Jelapang Road in January 1997.

PRIME was carried out at its existing site in November 2000 and completed in April 2003.The upgrading has expanded and enhanced our school facilities to cater to the increasing pupil enrolment.

In 2013, under PERI, the school’s Indoor Sports Hall was constructed to promote sports activities in the school and community under all weather conditions. 

Since the inception of the GRPS positive education in 2014, the school experiences included teaching skills of achievement alongside the skills of well-being. The implementation of the school-based positive education package at every level allows Form Teachers to know the needs, interests and strengths of students better. 

The undergirding philosophy of positive education is that if academic excellence and student well-being are emphasised together, students are able to do better. Moving ahead to align with CCE 2021, our school aims to build a caring and enabling school environment where every student flourishes. In particular, the implementation includes approaches of Positive Education, Student Leadership, Peer Support & Relationships (PSR) and Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR). 

The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) started in 2020 and involves Computational Thinking to develop empathetic, resilient solvers (CO.D.E.R.S) seeks to develop computational thinking through coding to prepare students for the tech-driven future. Students develop empathy and resilience through the process of understanding and solving the problem related to health sciences, using the Design Thinking process. 

The learning experiences are further enhanced with the construction of C.O.V.E. in 2022, a makerspace that engages students in creativity and student-initiated projects. The school also furnishes students with E3 (Enriching, Enhancing Experiences) aimed at fostering joy of learning and interest in our students. 

The school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) NE2+ started in 2015, which aims to Nurture Ethical and Effective Leaders with Positive Mind-sets. It incorporates the Head, Heart and Hands which enables students to acquire knowledge, internalize the learning and having the will to act and lead. 

In the process, it includes inculcation of values, social emotional competencies and understanding of cultural diversity and community issues. The key programmes include Values-In-Action (VIA) as well as Student leadership programmes that anchors on five practices of exemplary leadership model by Kouzes and Posner.
