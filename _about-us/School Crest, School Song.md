# School Crest, School Song

### School Crest

     style="width:40%">

### School Badge

The three peaks in the background symbolises our motto: GRACIOUS, RESPONSIBLE AND PUBLIC-SPIRITED

The fourth peak in the foreground represents the wholesome Greenridgean who is ready and prepared to face the challenges ahead and the fifth peak in the centre represents the nurturing of a global citizen ready to serve the broader community and beyond.

The ridge as a whole symbolises the effect Greenridgeans will have on the community, by having the strength of character, integrity and role-modeling the values of exemplary citizenship.

### School Song

<u><b>March of the Greenridgeans</b></u>

Unite Greenridgeans, stand strong!  
Strive to be Gracious, Responsible  
Public-Spirited and just  
Forever loyal always true  
We'll be to Greenridge Primary School

Step by step and day by day  
We grow up the Greenridge way  
Responsible for our deeds  
Courageously we take our stand  
Accounting our deeds to the end

Be ready all Greenridgeans to serve  
Giving others love that they deserve  
To give always with a gracious heart  
Be ready all Greenridgeans to serve  
Giving others love that they deserve  
Right from the heart  
We will do our part.
