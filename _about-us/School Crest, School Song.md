# School Crest, School Song

### School Crest

### School Badge

The three peaks in the background symbolises our motto: GRACIOUS, RESPONSIBLE AND PUBLIC-SPIRITED

The fourth peak in the foreground represents the wholesome Greenridgean who is ready and prepared to face the challenges ahead and the fifth peak in the centre represents the nurturing of a global citizen ready to serve the broader community and beyond.

The ridge as a whole symbolises the effect Greenridgeans will have on the community, by having the strength of character, integrity and role-modeling the values of exemplary citizenship.
