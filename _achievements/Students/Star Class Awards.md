# Star Class Awards

The Star Class Award is an award that every class look forward to at the end of each year. This award is designed to reinforce positive behaviour and encourage holistic excellence in pupils as a class. It also aims to infuse the existing systems of pupil recognition and recognize classes with passionate learners who embody the GRPS values.  
  
Towards the end of each year, one deserving class from each level will be chosen as the winner of Star Class Award for demonstrating passion for learning through reading and the use of technology, progress in academic performance, constructive ideas or contributions for quality learning experience, excellence in sports and aesthetics and character development by displaying the GRPS values.  
  
The classes that win this award, will be etched on a plaque and put up for display to highlight their achievement and will also be provided with a movie screening session equipped with age appropriate values in school in order to provide the class with an opportunity to celebrate their teamwork and success.
