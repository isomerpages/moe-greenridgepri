### **ALP: Computational Thinking to Develop Empathetic, Resilient Solvers (CO.D.E.R.S)**

Our ALP Curriculum is aligned to the Ministry of Education’s initiative of enabling students to develop an appreciation of computational thinking and coding concepts through simple visual programming-based lessons.&nbsp; With our focus on Health Science, we aim to integrate the key student experiences in the areas of computational thinkers, makers, student leadership, community service and character development for greater coherence and purpose, aligned to the Character and Citizenship Education outcomes.&nbsp;Through our ALP, students sharpen their competencies in **critical, adaptive and inventive thinking, and hone their problem-solving and collaborative skills**.

### **Computational Thinking and Coding**

##### **Primary 1**

Our Primary 1 students will be introduced to the exciting world of coding through a friendly robot called Kubo. Kubo is specifically designed to make coding fun and accessible for young learners. Students will embark on interactive activities and puzzles that will teach them the basics of coding logic and sequencing. They will learn how to program Kubo to navigate mazes, play games, and solve challenges, all while developing their problem-solving and critical thinking skills. 

##### **Primary 2**

In Primary 2, students will progress to Scratch Junior, a beginner-friendly programming language that allows them to create their own interactive stories, animations, and games. Through colorful and engaging coding blocks, students will learn how to code characters and objects, add sounds and animations, and create their own unique projects. They will discover the joy of creating and sharing their interactive creations while honing their creativity and computational thinking skills.

##### **Primary 3**

In Primary 3, students will continue their coding journey with Scratch, a widely used visual programming language. Scratch empowers young learners to create interactive projects, such as animated stories, games, and simulations. Students will dive deeper into coding concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals, enabling them to build more complex and interactive projects. They will also have the opportunity to explore the vibrant Scratch community, sharing their creations and gaining inspiration from others.

##### **Primary 4**

In Primary 4, students will be introduced to the exciting world of physical computing with Microbit. Microbit is a small programmable device equipped with various sensors and LED lights. Students will learn how to code the Microbit to interact with the physical world, such as creating simple games, displaying messages, and responding to external inputs. This hands-on experience will enhance their understanding of coding and enable them to bridge the gap between software and hardware.



##### **Primary 5**

Building upon their knowledge from the previous levels, Primary 5 students will delve deeper into the possibilities of Microbit programming. They will explore advanced features and functionalities, allowing them to create more sophisticated projects. Students will develop their problem-solving skills by applying the Microbit to real-world scenarios. They will design and code projects that can solve everyday problems, such as reminder system, interactive displays, or smart devices. This will encourage students to think critically, innovate, and apply their coding skills to practical applications.


### **Makers Movement**

##### Makerspace@COVE

Our school’s ALP focuses on STEM to provide students a learning experience where they explore freely through hands-on activities while applying the concepts and skills which they have learnt in real world contexts. We have creatively converted the school bookshop into a makerspace. Our staff and students have casted their votes and named it COVE - Caring Oasis for Values Education. Many students have been visiting the COVE during recess and also signed up for the termly Special Interest Group (SIG) held every Mondays and Wednesdays by a group of dedicated teachers to further ignite the passion in making and STEM.

##### Makers@Recess

The COVE is opened during recess for P3 to P6 students who would like to experiment with simple making and explore creative solution finding. The students can spend up to a week or more to complete what they want to make. In the process, the students will develop values such as resilience to come up with the end product and collaborative skills when working with their peers, teachers and parent volunteers.

##### Makers@SIG

![](/images/Joy%20of%20Learning/ALP%20&amp;%20E3/alp2023%20(8).png)

This special interest group comprises of P3 to P6 students who sign up on a termly basis meeting every week with a group of teachers to complete a makers activity and presenting their artefact to their peers. In this weekly 1.5 hour session, students are able to plan, design, build, present and improve on their prototypes. It is exciting to see that given the time, space and tools, the students can create amazing and innovative ideas.

##### Makers@Home and STEM Challenge

In addition, we want all students to have the excitement to discover and build. To provide students with opportunities for thinking and doing, we introduce maker activities for Primary 1 to P6 as part of Makers@Home. It is a series of maker activities where lessons and instructions are given on Student Learning Space (SLS) for students to be involved in creative and meaningful making.
