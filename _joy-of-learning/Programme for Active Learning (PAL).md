#### **Programme for Active Learning**

Programme for Active Learning or commonly termed as PAL, was borne out of the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Committeeâ€™s recommendations in 2009. Students are broadly exposed to varied and fun learning experiences via the following areas: Sports & Games, Outdoor Education, Visual and Performing Arts. Through these experiences, students learn social and emotional (SEL) competencies as well as the 3Cs i.e. confidence, curiousity, cooperation. Thus, these facilitates the holistic development of students in the different domains i.e. cognitive, moral, social, aesthetics and physical.

For Greenridge Primary School, we focus on the following areas for each level.

* Primary 1: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Music & Drama

* Primary 2: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Dance & Visual Art

Classes are scheduled to conduct different areas for each term. Each area is taught over 7 lessons lasting 1.5 hours each. The lessons are conducted by teachers who take the role of a facilitator and the focus is not on completing the activity but giving students the opportunity to undergo an experience that surfaces teachable moments towards their holistic development. Students get to reflect and share their thoughts based on their experiences during the activities.
