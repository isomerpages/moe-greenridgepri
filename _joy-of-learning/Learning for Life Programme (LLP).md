### **Values in Action @ GRPS**

In 2015, our school applied and was successfully awarded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in the category of **Community Service & Student Leadership**. Our school has always aspired to develop engaged learners who would use the knowledge and leadership skills to bring a positive difference and happiness to people’s life. 

Our school’s Learning for Life Programme is aligned with the school’s vision, mission and values and are age appropriate. The learning experiences aptly fit the renewed 2021 Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) domains, developmental milestones and learning outcomes.

##### **GRPS Student Leadership Development Program**

The school’s student leadership development program is based on Kouzes and Posner’s “Leadership Challenge”. We endeavour to inculcate in our students the principles behind Modelling the Way, Inspiring a Shared Vision, Challenging the Process, Enabling Others to Act and Encouraging the Heart. At the P4 and P5 levels the will be put through leadership workshops that will aim to help them nurture and develop their leadership traits, the workshops will be focusing on their “self-leadership” and “team leadership” respectively. Currently, our prefects in the prefectorial board, peer support leaders and class monitors all receive leadership training to equip them for the role that they play in our school.

Coming into a new environment, our P1 students quickly learn to take personal responsibility for their well-being by learning how to keep their hands and personal space clean. The students learn how to properly wash their hands using the six-step handwashing. The students reflect on their experience and draw advocacy posters to remind everyone to observe personal hygiene. They also share the knowledge with their families and friends.


##### **Primary 2 - Clean Classrooms @ GRPS**

In Primary 2, the students’ learning experience develops from personal responsibility to social responsibility. They learn to keep shared spaces at home, school and neighbourhood clean. In this VIA programme, the students get to learn the early history of the hygiene conditions of Singapore. The students also learn how Singapore earned the reputation of a clean and green city and their roles and responsibility to keep common spaces clean, like the school homes and neighbourhood clean. Then, the  students engage in cleaning up their classroom and common space. The students then apply what they have learnt back at home to keep their room and house clean.


##### **Primary 3 - Dengue Fighters @ GRPS**

The P3 VIA programmes exposes students to a perpetual public health issue in Singapore. This programme creates an awareness of the dengue situation in Singapore and how our young ‘Dengue Fighters’ can help to keep their home and school safe. The students learn about the life cycle of an Aedes mosquito and how to identify them from other mosquitoes. They also learn about mosquitoes breeding and the harmful effects of coming down with dengue fever. After the learning, the students set out to find and eradicate mosquito breeding spots in school. They take a pledge to always remain a ‘Dengue Fighter’ by constantly doing the mozzie wipe-out at home. The students also draw anti-dengue posters to create awareness among their friends in school.


##### **Primary 4 & 5 - Igniting the Spark**

The Primary 4 and Primary 5 students’ VIA programme is multi-disciplinary. The P4 students begin their VIA by reading a newspaper article to trigger their interest to learn more about the obesity problem among youth in Singapore. Through their follow-up discussion with their peers, the students explore ways to create a product that can assist them to lead a healthy lifestyle. They programme a microbit device as a step tracker and successfully test their product by using it themselves.

The Primary 5 students use the microbits knowledge they learnt in primary 4 to develop assistive aids for seniors in the community to use. They begin their projects by reading newspaper articles on elderlies and the daily problems the seniors encounter. The P5 students are then encouraged to programme microbits that could remind seniors to take their medication on time by setting off an alarm.


##### **Primary 6 - Passion to Serve Others**

The Primary 6 students are empowered to identify and choose community problems they would like to creatively solve. The students had learnt design thinking in Primary 4 and 5. They use the knowledge to identify a community problem, brainstorm for solutions and build a prototype to solve the problem. One of the classes learnt about families that do not have basic food supplies to feed their family. They collaborated with an external agency to organise a community food drive in school. They successfully collected over 500kg of food supplies that were distributed to the needy in our community.
