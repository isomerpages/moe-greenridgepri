### **High Ability Learners Programme (HAL)**

The GRPS HAL Framework is based on Treffinger’s Talent Development Model. Using the Levels of Service (LoS) model, students move through a continuum, beginning with opportunities to discover new areas of interest and then to explore areas of sustained interest before being engaged to gain mastery of a talent area.

The placement of students within the levels is essentially informed by student-driven interests and talents. This naturally allows for Engaged Learners to emerge and bolstered by the school’s CCE framework, to embark on the journey to becoming Caring Leaders in their talent areas.

The GRPS HAL Framework adopts an inclusive approach that allows for each child’s potential to be achieved through exposure to enrichment opportunities within and outside the core curriculum. As the child progresses through the various LoS, customisation to the child’s strengths and areas of talent is achieved by narrowing and deepening the enrichment opportunities. This approach allows for maximisation of students’ potential through customised curriculum.

Within the curriculum, HA students experience differentiated instruction either through banded classes or DI within mixed classes. Students are channeled into student-specific talent areas from a wide spectrum of opportunities and interests; thereby giving rise to a unique and customized talent development route for each child.
