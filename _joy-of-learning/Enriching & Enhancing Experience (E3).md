### **Enriching and Enhancing Experience (E3)**

Our school aims to promote the development of interests and joy of learning in our students through providing them with different learning experiences. These learning experiences are  further enhanced by leveraging Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to conduct lessons and encourage participation. The nature and delivery of ICT infused lessons not only encourage students to be independent learners but also allow learning to take place outside the classroom where groups of pupils collaborate by sharing information and providing feedback. Through these experiences, we hope that our students will be more self-directed to explore and deepen their areas of interest.

Through blended learning, we hope to inculcate independence in learning, ignite our students’ curiosity and develop them into self-directed lifelong learners.
