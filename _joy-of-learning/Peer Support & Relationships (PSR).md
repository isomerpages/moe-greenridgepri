#### **Enhancing the Peer Support Culture at Greenridge Primary**

Our school provides a 3-tier approach to enhancing the peer support culture and strengthening the key aspects of Peer Bonding, Peer Helping and Peer Influencing in Peer Support and Relationships (PSR).

##### **Tier 1 – Every Greenridgean is a Peer Supporter**

It is our mission to develop all Greenridgeans as Engaged Learners, Caring Leaders. We believe that every Greenridgean can be a good peer supporter to their friends. As part of our school-wide approach to enable a culture of care amongst students and staff, students revisit the importance of peer support and learn useful strategies in seeking help and giving help to their peers in need.

##### **Tier 2B – Peer Support Leaders (SEN)**

As an inclusive school, we recognise the demands and stressors faced by our students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) and embrace efforts to help assimilate them into mainstream school life. In line with our Tier 1 belief that every Greenridgean can be a good peer supporter, equal leadership opportunities are provided to our SEN students who demonstrate suitable PSL dispositions. Our SEN PSL leverages the school-based structured peer support intervention approach “Circle of Friends” to look out for and guide their SEN peers.

We are heartened and proud of the progress made by our PSL in their journey to be Caring Leaders thus far.
