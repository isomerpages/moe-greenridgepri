### Introduction to Sally's Value Wall (6 LOYALTY 2014)

(written by Mdm Deborah)

Values and Education should always go hand in hand. At least, that has been Sally's belief all these years. So, when she met her class, she reflected on how she could convey this to her pupils. She felt It was pertinent for her pupils to excel in both their academics and character and that some things, such as values, were caught and not taught. 

  

      One day, she proceeded to put up some adjectives on the wall. They were of values and she asked her pupils if they could identify with at least a few of them. Then, she invited them to write notes to their friends who possessed at least one of these qualities. She could sense some hesitation as this was something new to them. Hence, she started the ball rolling by writing notes of appreciation for some of the pupils who had displayed certain values, hoping that by modelling this behaviour, they will be encouraged to write their own notes.

  

     She left the Post-it note pad at the back of the class and encouraged them to show their appreciation towards their peers. Although only five pupils took the initiative, she was happy. From none to five! That, to her, signalled the start of a beautiful journey.

  

     During the next FTGP period, she asked her class to write at least one note for their buddy and to put it up on the wall. By now, her pupils were warming up to the idea and started to pen notes of thanks for even the teachers, including herself. She was touched by their kind gesture.

  

     Since this had caught on well with her class, she encouraged them to write notes of encouragement to at least one friend before and after SA1, regardless of the performance. She could tell that it really was starting to become easier for them to use positive reinforcement of values using these notes. Soon, the wall was brimming with notes so she removed the older ones and kept them. They will be returned at the end of the year to reinforce some of the values their peers have recognised in them.

  

    Her class is still on this journey of building the Value Wall and they invite you to join them too!
