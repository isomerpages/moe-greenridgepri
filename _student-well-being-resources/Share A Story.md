<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Compassion is in the Eyes</b> (contributed by Mdm Hasrinah)</p>

It was a bitter cold evening in northern Virginia many years ago. The old man’s beard was glazed by winter’s frost while he waited for a ride across the river. The wait seemed endless. His body became numb and stiff from the frigid north wind. 

He heard the faint, steady rhythm of approaching hooves galloping along the frozen path. Anxiously, he watched as several horsemen rounded the bend. He let the first one pass by without an effort to get his attention. Then another passed by, and another. Finally, the last rider neared the spot where the old man sat like a snow statue. As this one drew near, the old man caught  the rider’s eye and said, “Sir, would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side? There doesn’t appear to be a passageway by foot.”    

Reining his horse, the rider replied, “Sure thing. Hop aboard.” Seeing the old man was unable to lift his half-frozen body from the ground, the horseman dismounted and helped the old man onto the horse. The horseman took the old man not just across the river, but to his destination, which was just a miles away. 

As they neared the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman’s curiosity caused him to inquire, “Sir, I notice that you let several other riders pass by without making an effort to secure a ride. Then I came up and you immediately asked me for a ride. I’m curious why, on such a bitter winter night, you would wait and ask the last rider. What if I had refused and left you there?” 

The old man lowered himself slowly down from the horse, looked the rider straight in the eyes, and replied, “I’ve been around these here parts for some time. I reckon I know people pretty good.” The old-timer continued, “I looked into the eyes of the other riders and immediately saw there was no concern for my situation. It would have been useless even to ask them for a ride. But when I looked into your eyes, kindness and compassion were evident. I knew, then and there, that your gentle spirit would welcome the opportunity to give me assistance in my time of need.” 

Those heartwarming comments touched the horseman deeply. “I’m most grateful for what you have said, “he told the old man. “May I never get too busy in my own affairs that I fail to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion.” 

With that, Thomas Jefferson turned his horse around and made his way back to the White House.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Cipher in the Snow</b></p>

It started with tragedy on a biting cold February morning. I was driving behind the Milford Corners bus as I did most snowy mornings on my way to school. It veered and stopped short at the hotel, which it had no business doing, and I was annoyed as I had to come to an unexpected stop. A boy lurched out of the bus, reeled, stumbled and collapsed on the snow bank at the curb. The bus driver and I reached him at the same moment. His thin, hollow face was white even against the snow.

            “He’s dead, “ the driver whispered.

            It didn’t register for a minute. I glanced quickly at the scared young faces staring down at us from the school bus. “A doctor! Quick! I’ll phone from the hotel.”

            “No use. I tell you, he’s dead.” The driver looked down at the boy’s still form. “He never even said he felt bad, “ he muttered, “ “just tapped me on the shoulder and said, real quiet, ‘I’m sorry. I have to get off at the hotel.’ That’s all. Polite and apologizing like.”

            At school, the giggles, shuffling morning noise quieted as the news went down the halls. I passed a huddle of girls. “Who was it? Who dropped dead on the way to school?” I heard one of them half whisper.

            “Don’t know his name; some kid from Milford Corners,” was a reply.

            It was like that in the faculty room and the principal’s office. “I’d appreciate you going out to tell the parents,” the principal told me. “They haven’t a phone, and anyway, somebody from school should go there in person. I’ll cover your classes.”

            “Why me?” I asked. “wouldn’t it be better if you did it?”

            “I didn’t know the boy,” the principal admitted levelly. “And in last year’s sophomore personalities column I noticed that you were listed as his favorite teacher.”

            I drove through the snow and cold down the bad canyon road to the Evans’ place and thought about the boy, Cliff Evans. His favorite teacher! Why, he hadn’t spoken two words to me in two years! I could see him in my mind’s eye all right, sitting back there in the last seat in my afternoon literature class. He came in the room by himself and left by himself. “Cliff Evans,” I muttered to myself, “a boy who never smiled. I never saw smile once.”

            The big ranch kitchen was clean and warm. I blurted out my news somehow. Mrs. Evans reached blindly for a chair. “He never said anything about bein’ ailing.”

            His stepfather snorted. “He ain’t said nothin’ about anything since I moved in here.”

            Mrs. Evans got up, pushed a pan to the back of the stove and began to untie her apron. “Now hold on,” her husband snapped. “I got to have breakfast before I go to town. Nothin’ we can do now anyway. If Cliff hadn’t been so dumb, he’d have told us he didn’t feel good.”

            After school I sat in the office and stared bleakly at the records spread out before me. I was to close the boy’s file and write his obituary for the school paper. The almost bare sheets mocked the effort. “Cliff Evans, white, never legally adopted by stepfather, five half-brothers and sisters.” These meager strands of information and the list of D grades were about all the records had to offer.

            Cliff Evans had silently come in the school door in the mornings and gone out the school door in the evenings, and that was all. He had never belonged to a club. He had never played on a team. He had never held an office. As far as I could tell, he had never done one happy, noisy kid thing. He had never been anybody at all.

            How do you go about making a boy into a zero? The grade-school records showed me much of the answer. The first- and second-grade teachers’ annotations read “sweet, shy child; timid but eager.” Then the third grade note had opened the attack. Some teacher had written in a good, firm hand, “Cliff won’t talk. Uncooperative. Slow learner.” The other academic sheep had followed with “dull,” “slow-witted,” “low IQ.” They became correct. The boy’s IQ score in the ninth grade listed at 83. But his IQ in the third grade had been 106. The score didn’t go under 100 until the seventh grade. Even timid, sweet children have resilience. It takes time to break them.

            I stomped to the typewriter and wrote a savage report pointing out what education had done to Cliff Evans. I slapped a copy on the principal’s desk and another in the sad, dog-eared file, slammed the file and crashed the office door shut as I left for home. But I didn’t feel much better. A little boy kept walking after me, a boy with a peaked face, a skinny body in faded jeans, and big eyes that had searched for a long time and then had become veiled.

            I could guess how many times he’d been chosen last to be a team, how many whispered child conversations had excluded him. I could see the faces and hear the voices that said over and over, “You’re dumb. You’re dumb. You’re just a nothing, Cliff Evans.”

            A child is a believing creature. Cliff undoubtedly believed them. Suddenly it seemed clear to me: When finally there was nothing left at all for Cliff Evans, he collapsed on a snow bank and went away. The doctor might list “heart failure” as the cause of death, but that wouldn’t change my mind.
